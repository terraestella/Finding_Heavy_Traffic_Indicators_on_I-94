This project will attempt to analyse a dataset about the westbound traffic on I-94 Interstate highway (cars moving from Saint Paul in the East towards Minneapolis in the West). The station which were used to measure the traffic was located approximately midway between these two cities.

The goal of this analysis is to determine indicators of heavy traffic for that particular highway. Indicators may include weather conditions, temperature, time of the day, time of the week, etc.

The Dataset columns are as follows:

`holiday` - Categorical US National holidays plus regional holiday, Minnesota State Fair

`temp` - Numeric Average temperature in kelvin

`rain_1h` - Numeric Amount in mm of rain that occurred in the hour

`snow_1h` - Numeric Amount in mm of snow that occurred in the hour

`clouds_all` - Numeric Percentage of cloud cover

`weather_main` - Categorical Short textual description of the current weather

`weather_description` - Categorical Longer textual description of the current weather

`date_time` - DateTime Hour of the data collected in local CST time

`traffic_volume` - Numeric Hourly I-94 ATR 301 reported westbound traffic volume
